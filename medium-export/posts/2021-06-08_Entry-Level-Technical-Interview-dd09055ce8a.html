I will go over the topics to the best of my memory and how the interviewer explained each topic. The company was a management and consulting firm for different hospitals and they have about 25 developers on the team that helped create and maintain websites for these hospitals.</p><p name="f798" id="f798" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My interviewer had 25 years of experience in programming and started back when Linux first came out. He asked to give a rating between 0–10 on how confident I was in each category between SQL, HTML5, CSS, JQuery, and PHP. I mostly gave a 5. He asked a lot of foundational questions.</p><p name="81a9" id="81a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">SQL — I did not do as well with SQL as what I thought. It’s a language that interacts with the DOM for managing databases. He asked me for things like what INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE was.</p><p name="08fa" id="08fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">HTML5 — Seems easy enough at first right? Wrong! My interview went over the technical verb-age for strong tags vs bold tags and why they’re used. Strong tag meant that it was stronger than the surrounding text.</p><p name="6f7c" id="6f7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He also asked me to explain what meta charset=”UTF-8&quot; was in HTML5. Basically it’s a universal readable code because in the past, code would be different in different languages.</p><p name="e891" id="e891" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">CSS — He explained that the good thing about CSS, is it’s safer to manipulate as a programmer. We went over what @ media query was and the basic layout of a CSS function was “question: answer”</p><p name="9619" id="9619" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The #foot-sitemap was the question and the margin was the answer. The 0 on the left was the top-bottom margins and the 2em was the left and right margin.</p><figure name="8a58" id="8a58" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*2XqeSp44lAL0V5rNyFWv3Q.png" data-width="396" data-height="162" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2XqeSp44lAL0V5rNyFWv3Q.png"></figure><p name="b29f" id="b29f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Another thing he asked was what’s better to use, px or em? I said em because is an adjustable measurement that would adjust to the users screen wether it’s on a computer or cell phone.</p><p name="27d5" id="27d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">JQuery — He asked me questions about an event-listener in JQuery. For some reason I had mentioned I knew JQuery but it was a lot more difficult than what I thought it was.</p><p name="c24e" id="c24e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">PHP — I had never made a functioning code with PHP and he was well aware of this. As far as the code he had me check out, it seemed pretty straight forward. Below is an image of my own experience with PHP and for anyone who has experience with programming, it’s a bit straight forward in some parts. I was never able to make it a functioning.</p><figure name="30da" id="30da" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*tu3vzQfrqY58znmArP3YEA.png" data-width="1602" data-height="1438" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tu3vzQfrqY58znmArP3YEA.png"></figure><p name="47be" id="47be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Another thing he asked in the interview was what an array was. Which is data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables).</p><p name="1ce5" id="1ce5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A lot of this is intimidating especially when you’re put on the spot. And to emphasis, knowing the foundations and studying them is super important, which I’ve been trying to really train up on and study the documentation for.</p><p name="4b96" id="4b96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Happy Hunting,</p><p name="ee6f" id="ee6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Alicia</p></div></div></section>
