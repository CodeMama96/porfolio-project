Then I started to think about, other than authors, do people actually name their own books and would the app be helpful? SO, I got the idea to create a Salon App after my trip to the hair salon and my stylist casually stated that salon technology was not up to date at all because I attempted to use Apple Pay.</p><p name="5590" id="5590" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This made me ambitious for my project to have both a user(client) and stylist(admin) side of the application. And the main focus would have been based on payment. The user would be able to log in, create an appointment and once the appointment was done, they’d be able to check out and pay for the service they get done.</p><p name="e91f" id="e91f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I started creating my project, something as simple as a booking calendar, became intimidating to build. Then I narrowed my project to focus on the user and allow them to create an appointment, to view the appointment, to delete it, to view the appointments by the service, and to create an appointment by the service. One of my greatest accomplishments from the project was being able to create an appointment by the service due to the difficulty of figuring out how to create a Nested Route.</p><figure name="c9d0" id="c9d0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*668w94lVDddeEcjpHWcnEw.png" data-width="1666" data-height="820" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*668w94lVDddeEcjpHWcnEw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Lines 9–11 for reference for Nested Routes</figcaption></figure><p name="c243" id="c243" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The reason for this accomplishment because I felt that I had no idea how to create a Nested Route and I didn’t think I’d need to use a Nested Route. In order to complete this requirement, this is where I had to have an “All Services” page and each service would be linked to a separate page that would list the appointments for that service.</p><p name="dfeb" id="dfeb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If I wanted to dive deeper into this, I would hypothetically have had my stylist model and have the availability of each stylist based on the services, and the date/times they were available.</p><p name="3c6d" id="3c6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What does this all go to say?</p><p name="1ce5" id="1ce5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As things come together, and the lessons are getting harder during my time at Flatiron School, it’s beginning to become easier to be driven to create a cool application (even though, I’m not quite where I want to be in my skill as a programmer). Attempting to shoot for the moon while against the time constraints and skill limitations, may be the only forces that stop me from truly diving deeper into the monster called Ruby on Rails.</p><p name="d372" id="d372" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Github Repo: <a href="https://github.com/CodeMama96/salon-app.git" data-href="https://github.com/CodeMama96/salon-app.git" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/CodeMama96/salon-app.git</a></p></div></div></section>
