This career allowed me to step foot in multi-million dollar properties, presidential suites, sprawling condos to cute studios in Brooklyn, as I roamed New York City looking for the next deal. Driven and meticulous about my career, I thought this could be my lasting career as a real estate agent and investor.</p><p name="26cd" id="26cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My career allowed me enjoyed the social scenes, partying in Tribeca, attending Fashion Week, and going out to eat at the most exclusive rooftop restaurants. I’d go to quaint coffee shops all over New York and go to all sorts of different events. Life was a movie that I never wanted to end. Real estate and NYC was my baby that I cared for, tended for and focused on 24/7.</p><p name="96a5" id="96a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">March of 2020, when Corona Virus began, I thought it’d would be something that would only last for a few weeks. As the days went by, and the restrictions got worse, I decided to go back home with my parents. In June, when things seemed better, I went back to work only to figure out that my partner and I was expecting our first child. How was I going to support a baby during a pandemic and after I haven’t been working for 2 months in the unknown state of the real estate market?</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="3d8f" id="3d8f" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*H48TQFx4msmm6gfvhE8haQ.jpeg" data-width="4032" data-height="3024" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*H48TQFx4msmm6gfvhE8haQ.jpeg"></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="0920" id="0920" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">During the Summer, I toyed around with the idea of studying UI/UX design but I didn’t know where to start because I sensed my career was coming to an end. The more and more I went along my pregnancy, doing my job was becoming very difficult for me. I couldn’t stand the landlords and what the real estate market had become over a very short amount of time even before CoVid-19. As an independent contractor, it wasn’t stable finally enough for me to be able to confidently focus on my child. I was between a rock and a hard place by this point. By end of September, I concluded that I needed to completely pivot my career as a Software Engineer. After careful analysis and hours of research, I decided to attend Flatiron School.</p><p name="33e3" id="33e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Through this pivot in my life, I knew becoming a software engineer, I could apply my grit, focus and skills I’ve learned through real estate to confidently begin a new career.</p><p name="98e4" id="98e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">~ Alicia, CodeMama</p></div></div></section>
