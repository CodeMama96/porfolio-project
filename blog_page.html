  <h2>Introduction 4-17-2023</h2>
  <p>Hi My name is Alicia<br>
    This is day 1 and I'm sharing a look into my life. I am a software developer by trade. I have owned a coffee business and when I relocated,<br>
    I have been just figuring it out. What are my next moves? What's going to continue to discipline me?<br> 
    Most days I workout after I drop my toddler off at daycare. <br>
    It's usually about a 45 minute workout session. If I have more time I'll take creatine. <br>
    Then I start looking at emails, check tickets at work and then I think of things to work on and anything else that needs my attention.<br>
